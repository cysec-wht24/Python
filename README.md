# Python

# Important Notes
- If you override __init__, you should call super().__init__()
unless you intentionally want to skip parent initialization and fully understand the consequences.

- Built-in array.array does NOT support true multi-dimensional arrays.
  If you try to make it “multi-dimensional”, it becomes a list of arrays (or lists).
