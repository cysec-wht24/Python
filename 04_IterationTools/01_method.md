binary files take third party libraries to open up
Here we will talk about basic files, text files, python files
This will teach how python work behind the scene when opening a file, or apply loops somewhere
Python has reimagined loops, behind the scene
>>> f = open('chai.py') 
this opens a file
now you have many methods to read the file
>>> f.readline()
‘import time\n'
>>> f.readline()
‘print("chai is here")\n'
>>> f.readLine()
‘username = "hitesh"\n'
>>> f.readline()
‘print (username)'
>>> f.xreadline()
''
>>> f.readline()
''
>>>
