Best Practices

Model Organization
1. Define leaf models first - Models with no dependencies
2. Build upward - gradually compose more complex models
3. Use clear naming - Make relationships obvious
4. Group related models - Keep models in logical modules

Performance Considerations
1. Deep nesting impacts performance - Keep reasonable depth
2. Large lists of nested models - Consider pagination
3. Circular References - Use carefully, can cause memory issues
4. Lazy Loading - Consider for expensive nested computations

Data Modelling Tips 
1. Model real-world relationships - Mirror your domain structure
2. Use Optional Appropriately - Not all relationships are required
3. Consider Union types - For polymorphic relationships
4. Validate buisness rules - Use model validators for cross-model logic
